how do i want the data to be structured

{
user
}

- users with user information
- users with friend list
- each user has contacts and with each contact they have zero or more stories

1. send have multiple "stories" (chats) with
2. contacts have first & last name, profile photo
3. text messages only
4. mt

Note: a story is like a chat, but it is either in progress or complete

- users with user data (this is kind of already handled by firebase auth to be honest)
- users can add contacts
- with each contact, user can have multiple "stories", in progress and/or complete
- groups can have names
- being added to a group, user can see previous stories
- removed from a group, user can't see any stories (maybe just the ones they've contributed to? not sure about this)

requests:

- post story
- post message
- get story
- put message
- put title
- put progress

How to create an endpoint

put firebase db stuff in components first and then probably move it to api
